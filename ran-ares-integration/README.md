## Create LinkML schema from the mappings

The file at `ran-ares-integration/src/ran_ares_integration/utils/riskares2linkml.py` creates a LinkML schema using the current mappings between ARES and Risk Atlas Nexus. The file needs to be updated whenever new mappings become available and are approved for introduction into Risk Atlas Nexus.

Update the file with the latest mappings and run below command.
```bash
python riskares2linkml.py
```
